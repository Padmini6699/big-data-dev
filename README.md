## Current
I am a student of the 2021 spring batch pursuing masters in Applied Computer Science.

## Background:
I am a native of Pochavaram, Andhra Pradesh and have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BVC college. In my leisure, I enjoy clicking pictures of nature. Also, I like creating different crafts to decorate my home.

## Plans:
I have no prior experience in the field of computers but my interest in programming has peaked after I started my masters. I feel like I have found my niche in front-end development and going forward, I would like to pursue the same.
